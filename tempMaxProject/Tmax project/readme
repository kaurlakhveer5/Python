Step 1: Requested maximum daily temperature data for burbank through API request
  Time period: 1970-2100
  Scnerios Used: historical, RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5
  Models: 'CanESM2', 'CNRM-CM5', 'HadGEM2-ES', 'MIROC5', 'GFDL-CM3'
  Units: C
  
Step 2: Make data ready for the next step
        Saved data in pandas dataframe
        Used Pivot tables to differentiate scnrios and models
        Labeled all the columns and set date index

Step3: Plot 95th and 90th percentile of 30 years of Tmax data for each model
        Found 30 year running 95th and 90th percentile for the data set 
        Plot Temp vs Year graph represetning 90th and 95th percentile for every Scneior separately
        plot 95th percentile of each scnerio on the same graph to compare them
