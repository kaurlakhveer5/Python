In this notebook (Probabilistic New Copy 10GCMs.ipynb), we analyzed the daily max data for San Joaquin Valley and found the significant difference in historical tmax and projected tmax temperatures. 
Below are more specification:

1. Download the data
  Requested the tmax daily-data using cal adapt API with following specifications:
  - Scnerio is histrocial and rcp 8.5. 
  - Place is San Joaquin Valley with coordinates (-120.1106 36.3744)
  - GCMs: CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5
2. Prep the Data 
  Divided the data into two groups 1961-1990 and 2021-2050
  For sake of simiplicity, chose July to observe maximum temperature 
3. Found Commulative Frequency of data
  Specified the total number of bins and label every data point with relative bin (used pd.cut function)
  Find the frequency of each bin by using groupby function
  Add the frequencies to find cummulative frequencies. Pandas's cumsum worked well here!
4. Plot Graphs
  Plotted histroical (1961-1990) cummulative frequencies vs projected (2021-2050) cummulative frequnecies on a same graph to find the relationship
  plotted hhistorical percentile vs projected percentile
  One more graph with historical Daily Tmax vs Projected Daily tmax
  
  Introduction (In All-GCMs_prediction Wild Fires-.ipynb Notebook): California fires have been very destructive in recent years. In this analysis, we observe the change in frequency of different events, which might lead to fires. For example, high precipitation in one year lead by very hot temperature in next year. We used the conditions that were originally specified in Balch et al., 2018. 
Upper tercile for precipitation from Oct of the prior year to April; top decile of temperature from May to September; bottom decile of precipitation from Sept to December; and, extremely hot Oct to December (OND) period (98th percentile or higher) when the wildfires would tend to occur when vegetation is dry.  The terciles, deciles, and percentiles were calculated from the 1961 to 1990 baseline period.  
Please note that this work is a replication of Franco Guido’s report “PROBABILISTIC” CLIMATE PROJECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. 

Variables: In this analysis, we use ten propriety models, and scnerios, rcp 8.5 to get daily tmax and daily precipitation. Data was requested from Cal-Adapt API for a loca grid that intersects the the point (-121.8677, 37.9833) in San Joaquin Valley. Historical Data is trimmed to 1961-1990.
