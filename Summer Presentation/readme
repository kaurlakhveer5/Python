This file contains the summary of my work in Summer 2019. 
This includes, analysis of Regional heat waves, Cumulative probabilistic distribution of tmax, and onset  precipitation. 
Also, I presented how to use Cal-adapt API to download data with different variables. All of my work is done in Python!
