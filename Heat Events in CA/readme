In this notebook, I have analyzed daily maximum tempertaure in LA, SD, SB, SJ, Sac and Fresno in California. 
Only days where tmax is gretaer than 90th percentile of historical (1961-1990) tempertaure are plotted. 
Every bubble represents one day on graph. Bubble color is based upon average temp of all places
In this analysis I have used CanESM GCM with rcp 8.5
