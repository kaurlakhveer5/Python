In this notebook, we analyzed the daily max data for San Joaquin Valley and found the significant difference in historical tmax and rojected tmax temperatures. 
Below are more specification:

1. Download the data
  Requested the tmax daily-data using cal adapt API with following specifications:
  - Scnerio is histrocial and rcp 8.5. 
  - Place is San Joaquin Valley with coordinates (-120.1106 36.3744)
  - GCMs: CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5
2. Prep the Data 
  Divided the data into two groups 1961-1990 and 2021-2050
  For sake of simiplicity, chose July to observe maximum temperature 
3. Found Commulative Frequency of data
  Specified the total number of bins and label every data point with relative bin (used pd.cut function)
  Find the frequency of each bin by using groupby function
  Add the frequencies to find cummulative frequencies. Pandas's cumsum worked well here!
4. Plot Graphs
  Plotted histroical (1961-1990) cummulative frequencies vs projected (2021-2050) cummulative frequnecies on a same graph to find the relationship
  plotted hhistorical percentile vs projected percentile
  One more graph with historical Daily Tmax vs Projected Daily tmax
